# GuildCraftsGoalReviewerProject

## Description

A repo that pulls in our goals/issues and displays them while maximizing a great UX.
Basically, you need to duplicate the functionality of a Rails app: [GitHub repo] (https://github.com/bluemihai/goals-viewer), [live on Heroku](https://goals-viewer-api.herokuapp.com/).

## Context

Serving an actual customer is a huge part of writing good software.  If you take on this goal, you will be the customer, and have access to 19 other users - so you can talk to them, and learn about good User Experience Design (UX).

## Required Specs (Must Have)

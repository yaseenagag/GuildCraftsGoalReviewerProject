# GuildCraftsGoalReviewerProject

## Description

A repo that pulls in our goals/issues and displays them while maximizing a great UX.
Basically, you need to duplicate the functionality of a Rails app: [GitHub repo] (https://github.com/bluemihai/goals-viewer), [live on Heroku](https://goals-viewer-api.herokuapp.com/).

## Context

Serving an actual customer is a huge part of writing good software.  If you take on this goal, you will be the customer, and have access to 19 other users - so you can talk to them, and learn about good User Experience Design (UX).

## Required Specs (Must Have)

- [ ] Pull data directly from GitHub, instead of storing data locally.
- [ ] An external, published, all-JS site which improves the UX of browsing/searching these goals

- [ ] Store voting data in GitHub
- [ ] Your site uses the GitHub API to access goal data.

# GuildCraftsGoalReviewerProject

Description

A repo that pulls in our goals/issues and displays them while maximizing a great UX.
Basically, you need to duplicate the functionality of a Rails app: GitHub repo, live on Heroku.

Context

Serving an actual customer is a huge part of writing good software. If you take on this goal, you will be the customer, and have access to 19 other users - so you can talk to them, and learn about good User Experience Design (UX).

Required Specs (Must Have)

 An external, published, all-JS site which improves the UX of browsing/searching these goals
 Basically, duplicate the functionality of https://goals-viewer-api.herokuapp.com/
 You use the same schema described in https://github.com/bluemihai/goals-viewer
 Your site uses the GitHub API to access/one-way sync the actual goals from this repo's issues
 You schedule an hourly task to perform this sync, but can also do it on demand
 You have interviewed at least three potential users at your app and integrated their feedback
 Your site uses a database (SQL or Mongo) to store additional information about each goal
 Choose Angular, React or another framework to create a smooth, one-page app UX
 Determine whether you want a Service-Oriented Architecture (front-end
 You can search/filter the full description in table view
 Anonymous users can upvote or downvote the goals
 Registered (or anonymous) users can review goals
 The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the MIT license.
Optional Specs (Nice To Have)

 Auth is handled through GitHub Oauth
 Add another view, such as goals-as-cards and/or a nicely detailed show page for goals
 Integrate with echo to pull in info of who's already completed one goals (instead of having to enter it manually as currently done)
 Be creative! Anything you can think of, that you or users would want
 Write all your code in ES2015
 Add unit and feature tests
 Create an iOS app

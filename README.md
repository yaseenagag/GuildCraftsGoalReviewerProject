# GuildCraftsGoalReviewerProject

## Description

A repo that pulls in our goals/issues and displays them while maximizing a great UX.
Basically, you need to duplicate the functionality of a Rails app: [GitHub repo] (https://github.com/bluemihai/goals-viewer), [live on Heroku](https://goals-viewer-api.herokuapp.com/).

## Context

Serving an actual customer is a huge part of writing good software.  If you take on this goal, you will be the customer, and have access to 19 other users - so you can talk to them, and learn about good User Experience Design (UX).

## Required Specs (Must Have)

- [ ] An external, published, all-JS site which improves the UX of browsing/searching these goals 
- [ ] Basically, duplicate the functionality of https://goals-viewer-api.herokuapp.com/
- [ ] You use the same schema described in https://github.com/bluemihai/goals-viewer
- [ ] Your site uses the GitHub API to access/one-way sync the actual goals from this repo's issues
- [ ] You schedule an hourly task to perform this sync, but can also do it on demand
- [ ] You have interviewed at least three potential users at your app and integrated their feedback
- [ ] Your site uses a database (SQL or Mongo) to store additional information about each goal
- [ ] Choose React to create a smooth, one-page app UX
- [ ] Determine whether you want a Service-Oriented Architecture (front-end
- [ ] You can search/filter the full description in table view
- [ ] Anonymous users can upvote or downvote the goals
- [ ] Registered (or anonymous) users can review goals
- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license][mit-license].

## Optional Specs (Nice To Have)

- [ ] Auth is handled through GitHub Oauth
- [ ] Add another view, such as goals-as-cards and/or a nicely detailed show page for goals
- [ ] Integrate with echo to pull in info of who's already completed one goals (instead of having to enter it manually as currently done)
- [ ] Be creative!  Anything you can think of, that you or users would want
- [ ] Write all your code in ES2015
- [ ] Add unit and feature tests
- [ ] Create an iOS app
